# VisSystem Frontend

The frontend service of comparative visual analytics for evolutionary processes. Programming in Python language.

## Environment Requirement

- **Node.js** version `>= 18.16.0` (Maybe you can run the frontend on some Node.js versions that are out of date successfully, but we are not recommand for doing that since it could lead to some implicit problems.)

## Deploy and Running

To start the frontend, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Start a terminal and go to the `frontend` folder directory.
2. Ensure that you have a **correct** Node.js environment on your computer, and then execute `npm install` or `yarn` (if you are using `yarn` as Node.js package manager)
3. Execute `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` in the terminal.
